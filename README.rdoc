== notifier_wrapper

A wrapper for notifiers in various plataforms.

It can handle libnotify in Unix-plataforms, snarl on Windows, and Growl in
in Mac OS X. The proper ruby bindings for those libraries must be installed.

ATTENTION: It was tested only on Ubuntu using libnotify, but the code for snarl
and Growl seems so simple that it will probably just work! :)
